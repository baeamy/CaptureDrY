# Capture Dr. Y
Pac-Man-inspired Game on TM4C Microcontroller Using Embedded C.

How to run Capture Dr. Y:
To run this game, you must obtain the Keil μVision Commercial Use License. This game is designed to be played on the ST7735R LCD.

Introduction:
This game is dedicated to my favorite professor at The University of Texas at Austin, Dr. Ramesh Yerraballi. He left UT Austin for a year, and I designed this game to commemorate his departure. Dr. Y used to bike to school on a bike that he built himself, so the objective of this game is to collect all of his bike components (1 handle and 2 wheels) to win. The three "ghosts" or hunters in this game are my Graduate Teaching Assistants: Malav, Sophia, and Dinesh. If you successfully collect all components without being captured by a hunter, Dr. Y becomes free. If you get captured before collecting all components, Dr. Y remains captured, but you may try again.

Game Instructions:
1. Pick a language: English or Spanish using the slidepot.
2. Navigate through the map using the arrow keys (if you are playing through Keil μVision simulation mode) or the arrow buttons (if you are playing on the ST7735R LCD setup).
3. Collect all components (1 handle and 2 wheels) while avoiding the Graduate TAs.

Thank you for playing Capture Dr. Y!
